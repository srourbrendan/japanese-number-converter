# Japanese Number Converter

This is a website for converting Arabic numbers to Japanese Kanji. It is written in Javascript. The website is hosted on Github Pages at [https://srourbrendan.github.io/japanese-number-converter/](https://srourbrendan.github.io/japanese-number-converter/).

# Usage

Enter a number in the input box and click the convert button. The result will be displayed below. The converter currently supports numbers between 1 and 10,000,000,000,000,000.

# Results

The result displays the number in Japanese Kanji with furigana, the number in Arabic numerals, and the number in Arabic numerals with commas. The results are color coded based on how the number is pronounced in Japanese. For example, 101,000 is said as "ten ten thousand one thousand" in Japanese, so the first two digits are orange, and the rest are blue.

The purpose of this is to help people who are learning Japanese to understand how numbers are pronounced in Japanese. The furigana is also useful for people who are learning to read Japanese.

# Other Features

## Show Furigana

The furigana can be toggled on and off. The default is on.
